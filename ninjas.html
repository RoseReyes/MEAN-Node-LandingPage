    <h1>Ninjas</h1>
    <p>A ninja or shinobi was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. </p>
    <p>The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.</p>
    <p>Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the samurai, who observed strict rules about honor and combat.</p>
    <p> The shinobi proper, a specially trained group of spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period,</p>
    <p> but antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.</p>
